Sentiment Analysis of restaurant reviews is a vital application of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. It involves automatically evaluating the sentiments expressed in customer reviews of restaurants. This analysis helps restaurants gain insights into customer satisfaction, identify strengths and weaknesses, and make informed decisions to enhance their services. Whether it's assessing positive experiences to improve on them or addressing negative feedback, Sentiment Analysis empowers restaurants to better understand and cater to their customers' preferences, ultimately leading to improved dining experiences and customer relationships.
